As a 3rd-year AI Engineering student in Pakistan, I’ve witnessed firsthand the immense stress and frustration students face when applying to universities. Every year, thousands of talented individuals spend countless hours manually filling out identical applications – a process that’s often confusing, time-consuming, and frankly, overwhelming. I built IlmSeUrooj to tackle this head-on, and I’m incredibly excited to share the progress!

IlmSeUrooj is a Next.js web application powered by Supabase for backend data storage and management, designed to streamline the university application process for Pakistani students. We’ve built a component-based architecture with a clear separation of concerns, utilizing technologies like React, Next.js 16+, and a CI/CD pipeline for efficient updates. The core of this system is a robust RLS (Real-Time Serverless) setup managed via Supabase, ensuring data integrity and user privacy.

Let's dive into some of the key features. The application boasts a Tinder-style swipe-based university discovery system, allowing students to quickly browse and save universities. Users can refine their search with a smart filter system encompassing field, degree level, program, hostel, city, and campus type. Saved universities are persistent via LocalStorage, complete with tags, notes, and even drag-and-drop reordering for personalized organization. We've built an admission chance predictor using a merit formula calculator, factoring in projected and IBCC (Inter Board Coordination Committee) support per university.  For detailed comparisons, there’s a university comparison tool allowing side-by-side evaluation of up to four institutions. Stay on top of deadlines with our admissions deadlines tracker, grouped by field and month, featuring countdowns. We’ve also included detailed entry tests information – covering NET, ECAT, SAT, and MDCAT – alongside historical cutoffs and personal score comparison tools.  Need a scholarship? Explore the scholarship panel offering need-based and merit-based opportunities with eligibility criteria. We’ve implemented a recommendation section based on user filters, and a similar universities feature for added discovery.  To keep things beautiful, we’ve incorporated a dark/light mode theme system with persistent preferences. The profile page is comprehensive, spanning 9 sections – personal, academic, education system (Pakistani/Cambridge), entry tests, portal credentials, preferences, and document uploads. 

But the real game-changer is our Chrome Extension! We've built a 3-tier autofill engine – starting with deterministic selectors, followed by an AI field mapping engine using Ollama, and concluding with heuristic detection – to seamlessly fill out university portals with over 17 universities currently configured. The extension is aware of academic status, intelligently handling projected marks, IBCC equivalence, and Cambridge/Pakistani system differences. A sidebar provides real-time state updates, while a popup features the ProfileRing and application list.  We’ve implemented a password vault with a generated, strong password, and a pre-submit validator to minimize errors. The system captures confirmation numbers and remembers answers to unique questions across universities.
