# UniMatch (IlmSeUrooj)
### One profile. Apply to any university in Pakistan.

UniMatch helps Pakistani students apply to multiple universities without filling the same form over and over. Create your profile once — your name, CNIC, marks, contact info — then install the Chrome extension and autofill any supported university portal in seconds. You review the form and click Submit yourself.

## What Works Right Now

### Website (localhost:3000)
- **Swipe-based university discovery** — swipe right to save, left to skip (Tinder-style)
- **Smart filter system** — field, degree level, program, hostel, city, campus type
- **Saved universities list** — persistent via localStorage, with tags, notes, reordering, drag-and-drop
- **Admission chance predictor** — merit formula calculator with projected/IBCC support per university
- **University comparison tool** — side-by-side comparison of up to 4 universities
- **Admissions deadlines tracker** — grouped by field and month with countdown
- **Entry tests info** — NET, ECAT, SAT, MDCAT with historical cutoffs and personal score comparison
- **Scholarships panel** — need-based and merit-based scholarships with eligibility
- **Recommendations section** — personalized suggestions based on filters
- **Similar universities** — based on saved list similarity
- **Theme system** — dark/light mode with persistent preference
- **Profile page** — 9 sections: personal, academic, education system (Pakistani/Cambridge), entry tests, portal credentials, preferences, documents
- **Profile completion ring** — percentage-based SVG in header
- **Floating action panel** — bottom-right FAB with quick links (hidden on profile/applications/extension)
- **Application dashboard** — kanban board (Saved → Applying → Submitted → Decision) with real-time updates, detail panel, notes
- **Header** — auth-aware with Sign In/Create Profile for guests, ProfileRing + dropdown for logged-in users
- **Extension landing page** — product page with install CTA, how-it-works, university grid, comparison table

### Chrome Extension
- **Per-university autofill** with 3-tier system (deterministic selectors → AI field mapping → heuristic detection)
- **17 universities** with mapped CSS selectors (all pending live verification)
- **Academic status aware** — handles projected marks, IBCC equivalence, Cambridge/Pakistani systems
- **Sidebar** with 7 states: unknown_portal, not_logged_in, warning_ibcc, warning_no_marks, loading, ready, filled, review, submitted
- **Popup** with ProfileRing, portal detection, application list, auth controls
- **Password vault** — generates one strong password, reuses across all portals
- **Pre-submit validator** — checks for empty required fields and inconsistencies
- **Submission detection** — captures confirmation numbers
- **Answer memory** — remembers answers to unique questions across universities
- **SOP/essay AI draft helper** — uses local Ollama to generate drafts (requires 20-char edit minimum)
- **Page type de

## 1. Swipe-Based University Discovery
**Status:** ✅ Working
**What it does:** Students discover universities by swiping right (save) or left (skip), similar to Tinder-style card browsing.
**How it works:** `SwipeCard` component renders cards from `rankUniversities()` in `src/utils/ranking.js`. Touch/mouse drag + keyboard arrows supported. Cards stack with peek-ahead.
**Education system aware:** No — shows all universities regardless of system.
**Connected to:** Filter system, Saved list (swipe right adds to saved), ranking utility.

---

## 2. Smart Filter System
**Status:** ✅ Working
**What it does:** Filters universities by field of study, degree level, program, hostel availability, city, and campus type.
**How it works:** `FilterSection` component in `src/components/FilterSection/`. Applies filters to `universities.js` data before ranking.
**Education system aware:** No.
**Connected to:** University list, Swipe cards, Recommendations.

---

## 3. Saved Universities List
**Status:** ✅ Working
**What it does:** Persistent shortlist with tagging, notes, reordering, drag-and-drop, and bulk comparison.

**Education system aware:** Yes — accepts IBCC equivalent % for Cambridge students; handles projected marks for Part-I only students.
**Connected to:** `useP

# UniMatch — Build Progress
Last updated: 2026-02-22
Built with: Google Antigravity + Claude Opus 4.6

## Current Stage
Core system complete — website features fully functional, extension autofill engine built with 17 university configs. All selector configs are mapped but marked `verified: false` pending active admissions cycle for live testing.

## Phase Completion
- [x] Phase 1 — Supabase tables + RLS + Storage bucket
- [x] Phase 2 — Chrome extension shell (MV3, content script, sidebar, popup)
- [x] Phase 3 — AI field mapping engine (3-tier: deterministic → Ollama → heuristic)
- [x] Phase 4 — Pre-submit review + submission tracking
- [x] Phase 5 — Manual fields + SOP helper + answer memory
- [x] Phase 6 — All universities + polish (17 universities)
- [x] Phase 7 — Password vault + context guard + skip Tier 2 for known unis
- [x] Phase 8 — Data scrapers + validators + GitHub Actions CI/CD
- [x] Phase 9 — University config fixes + name splitting + extension context guard
- [x] Phase 10 — Profile schema expansion (78 columns) + profile page rebuild (9 sections)
- [x] Phase 11 — UI improvements (Header, FloatingPanel, Extension page, Applications kanban, Sidebar states, Popup redesign)
- [x] Phase 12 — Full documentation rewrite (7 files)
