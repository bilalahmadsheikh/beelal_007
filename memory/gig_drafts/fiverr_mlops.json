  "title": "I will Build Your MLOps & ML Pipelines",
  "description": "I will help you streamline your Machine Learning workflows with robust MLOps solutions and high-performance ML pipelines. As an AI Engineering student (6th Semester) specializing in Python, Blockchain, and MLOps technologies, I bring a unique blend of practical experience and technical expertise. I focus on delivering tangible results, leveraging proven frameworks like FastAPI, MLflow, and Docker to optimize your ML projects.\n\nHere's what you get:\n\n*   **Custom MLOps Pipelines:** I’ll design and implement fully automated pipelines for training, deploying, and monitoring your models, drastically reducing your operational overhead. This includes integrating MLflow for experiment tracking and Docker for reproducible environments.\n*   **High-Performance ML Solutions:**  I’ve demonstrated expertise in achieving significant performance gains. For example, my basepy-sdk delivered a 40% performance improvement over Web3.py for interacting with the Base L2 blockchain.  I also developed a purchasing power prediction model with 87% accuracy and automated retraining, constantly improving results.\n*   **Scalable & Reliable Deployments:** I utilize modern cloud platforms like Supabase for rapid prototyping and scalable deployments, enabling you to serve up to 90,000 customers in the Pakistani SME market through my WhatsApp AI Chatbot.\n\n**Packages:**\n\n*   **Basic:**  I’ll build a simple MLOps pipeline with basic monitoring and deployment. (Price: $20, 3 days, 1 revision)\n*   **Standard:** A more comprehensive pipeline with automated retraining, detailed documentation, and enhanced monitoring. (Price: $65, 7 days, 2 revisions)\n*   **Premium:**  A fully customized solution including advanced features like integration with your existing infrastructure, comprehensive testing, and ongoing support. (Price: $130, 14 days, 3 revisions)",
