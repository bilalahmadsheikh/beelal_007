**As a student in Pakistan, I’ve always felt a little lost when trying to navigate the university application process. The sheer volume of options, the confusing forms, and the pressure to make a good impression... it’s a real challenge.  Every admission season, I’d watch my classmates navigate the same system, feeling a little overwhelmed.  That’s why I’m incredibly excited to share my project, IlmSeUrooj – a Next.js application built to streamline the university application experience, specifically targeting students in Pakistan.**

**Our Approach: A Next.js & Supabase Powered Solution**

IlmSeUrooj is a project born from a desire to improve the student application journey. We’ve designed it with a focus on user experience, leveraging the power of Next.js and Supabase to create a seamless and intelligent system. The core architecture is a component-based approach, built with Next.js 16+ and the App Router pattern - a smart choice to ensure a consistent and scalable user experience.  We’ve opted for a robust CI/CD pipeline, built with [GitHub Repo Link: https://github.com/bilalahmadsheikh/IlmSeUrooj](https://github.com/bilalahmadsheikh/IlmSeUrooj), to ensure data consistency and rapid updates.

**Here’s a breakdown of our key features:**

*   **Swipe-Based University Discovery:**  Forget endless scrolling through lengthy lists!  We’ve implemented a swipe-based university discovery system.  Users can swipe right on a university profile to save it – a simple, intuitive way to prioritize their applications.  This is a direct response to the problem of students getting lost in a sea of options.

*   **Smart Filter System – The Core of the Experience:**  We’ve built a smart filter system that allows students to search for universities based on criteria like student demographics, program types, hostel availability, city, and campus type.  The filter system is built upon a robust RLS setup.  The initial filters will be around 15 universities initially – think of it as a curated exploration experience.

*   **Saved Universities List (localStorage + Tags, Notes, Reordering, Drag-and-Drop):**  We’ve given students the power to save their favorite universities, along with tags, notes, and the ability to rearrange the list. This allows them to build a personalized ‘favorites’ feed and easily discover what’s important to them. 3-tier selector system ensures a reliable, deterministic filter - we've built a robust system to handle all the potential filtering scenarios.

*   **Admission Chance Predictor – Merit Formula Calculator:** We’ve created a predictive admission chance calculator that uses a merit formula, incorporating projected marks and IBCC equivalence (for Pakistani students).  It’s a crucial element for students aiming for high-scoring universities.

*   **University Comparison Tool:** A side-by-side comparison of up to 4 universities at a glance – providing students with a quick overview of the options before diving deeper. 

*   **Admissions Deadlines Tracker – Grouped by Field & Month:** Students can easily track deadlines for different fields, ensuring they don’t miss any important dates.  We've designed a Kanban board-style layout to keep it digestible.

*   **Entry Tests Info – NET, ECAT, SAT, MDCAT with Historical Cutoffs & Personal Score Comparison:**  We've integrated historical cutoffs and personalized score comparison for key entry tests to give students a realistic understanding of their chances.
